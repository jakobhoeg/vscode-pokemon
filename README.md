## Auto-spawn settings (automatic Pokémon)

The extension can automatically spawn Pokémon on a timer. Configure this under the `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn` settings.

- `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn.enabled` (boolean) — Enable automatic spawning.
- `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn.interval` (number, seconds) — Time in seconds between automatic spawn checks. Default: 20. Note: this value is now in seconds (was minutes in older versions); a one-time migration is applied where possible.
- `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn.maxPokemon` (number) — Maximum number of Pokémon allowed. When the number of spawned Pokémon reaches this value, the extension will apply the configured behavior. Default: 6.
- `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn.generations` (array of numbers) — Which Pokémon generations to spawn from (1, 2, 3). Empty array means all generations.
- `vscode-pokemon.autoSpawn.behavior` (string) — What to do when `maxPokemon` is reached. Options:
  - `evolve` — Try to evolve one existing Pokémon (if an evolution exists). If an evolution occurs, no replacement is done during that cycle.
  - `replace` — Remove a random Pokémon and spawn a new random one in its place.
  - `random` — Randomly choose between evolve or replace (50/50) on each auto-spawn cycle.
  - `doNothing` — Do not modify the collection once the maximum is reached.
  - `evolve_or_replace` — Choose either evolve or replace at random (50/50). This behaves similarly to `random` but is a more explicit option for evolve-vs-replace choices.
  - `evolve_then_replace` — Try to evolve an eligible Pokémon first. If no evolutions are possible, fall back to replacing a random Pokémon.

Example scenarios
- Keep a small, evolving collection: set `maxPokemon` to `3` and `behavior` to `evolve_then_replace`. The extension will try to evolve first and only replace when evolution isn't possible.
- Fast frequent spawns: set `autoSpawn.interval` to `60` (60 seconds) and `maxPokemon` to `6`. Use `replace` if you want the collection to frequently refresh with new types.
- Leave the collection intact after it fills: set `behavior` to `doNothing` so the extension never removes or evolves Pokémon once the limit is reached.

## Upcoming features

Extracting and creating .gif files involves quite a bit of tedious manual work, but I’ll aim to add Gen 4 soon!
